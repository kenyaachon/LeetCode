We typically apply dynamic programming to optimization problems. Such problems can have
have many possible solutions.

We call such a solution an optimal solution to the problem rather than the optimal solution
since there may be several solutions that achieve the optimal value.

when developing a dynamic programing algorithm, we follow a sequence of four steps:
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution
2. Recurisvely define the value of an optimal solution
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom up fashinon
4. construct an opttimal solution from computer information
